    "1. How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last years? \n",
    "2. How does this vary by country? How does this vary by type of natural disaster?  \n",

Therefore, the dataset must contain death counts as well as a history as long as possible (optimally in the range of 100 years). Question 2 focuses on the development in different countries and whether there are differences between different types of natural disasters. Therefore, the data set must include both geographic characteristics and attributes to distinguish between different types of natural disasters. "

    ">EM-DAT contains essential core data on the occurrence and effects of over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to the present day. The database is compiled from various sources, including UN agencies, non-governmental organisations, insurance companies, research institutes and press agencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, a detailed overview of the attributes used in the further analysis will be given. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data fields\n",
    "\n",
    " - `Disaster_Group`: Two different types of disasters can be distinguished in the EM-DAT database: natural disasters and technological disasters. Since we are only interested in natural disasters, only they were requested and consequently this field contains only the value *Natural*. No missing values are present for this attribute. \n",
    " - `Disaster_Subgroup`: Every natural disaster is assigned to one of the following six subgroups: *Biological, Geophysical, Climatological, Hydrological, Meteorological and Extra-terrestrial* to describe the type of natural disaster. No missing values are present for this attribute. \n",
    " - `Disaster_type`: For every natural disaster event one main disaster type is identified. If two or more disasters are related because they are consequences of each other, then this information is encoded in the attributes `Associated_Dis` and `Associated_Dis2`. No missing values are present for this attribute. \n",
    " \n",
    " - `Disaster Sub-Type`: Subdivision related to the attribute `Disaster_type` so that a the disaster type Storm can be further classified as tropical, extra-tropical or convective storm. \n",
    " \n",
    " - `Disaster Sub-Sub Type`: Any appropriate sub-division of the disaster sub-type (not applicable for all disaster sub-types).\n",
    " \n",
    "> Types of natural disasters could be further broken down using two more categories which would be available in the database. For example, the Disaster type *Storm* could be further subdivided into *Tropical storm*, *Extra-tropical storm* or *Convective storm*. Even a further subdivision of the category *Convective storm* would be possible. Since the analysis is aimed at detecting trends on a high level, the classification of each event based on the attributes `Disaster_Subgroup` and `Disaster _Type` was considered sufficient and the further subdivisions into `Disaster sub-type` and `Disaster Subsubtype` is only intended to be considered for detailed analysis. The full table is saved in /data/disaster_classification (w/o the technological disaster group) and shown in the Appendix of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `Associated_Dis`: Secondary event triggered by a natural disaster (i.e. Landslide for a flood, explosion after an earthquake, ...)\n",
    " - `Associated_Dis2`: Another secondary event triggered by a natural disaster. (i.e. Landslide for a flood, explosion after an earthquake, ...)\n",
    " \n",
    " Example: If a tsunami is triggered by an earthquake, then the attribute `Disaster_Type` would be *Earthquake*, the attribute `Disaster_Subtype` would be *Ground movement* and the attribute `Associated_Dis` would be *Tsunami/Tidal wave*.\n",
    " \n",
    " - `Country`: The country in which the disaster has occurred or had an impact. If a disaster has affected more than one country, a seperate entry is created in the database for each country affected. No missing values are present for this attribute. \n",
    " - `ISO`: Unique 3-letter code for each country defined by ISO 3166. No missing values are present for this attribute. \n",
    " - `Region`: The region to which the country belongs, based on the UN regional division. No missing values are present for this attribute. \n",
    " - `Continent`: The continent to which the country belongs. No missing values are present for this attribute. \n",
    " - `Start_Year`: The year when the disaster occurred. No missing values are present for this attribute.\n",
    " \n",
    " - `End Year`: The year when the disaster ended. No missing values are present for this attribute.\n",
    " \n",
    "> For sudden-impact disasters also the month and the day are well defined and available. For disaster situations developing gradually over a longer time period (i.e. drought) with no specific start date the day attribute is empty. For our questions the exact date plays a subordinate role and therefore the year of the beginning of the disaster is completely sufficient for our analysis.    \n",
    "\n",
    " - `Total_Deaths`: Number of people who lost their life because the event happened plus the number of people whose whereabouts since the disaster are unknown, and presumed dead based on official figures. Missing values present for approx. 25% of all events.\n",
    " \n",
    " - `No_Affected`: Number of people which requiring immediate assistance during an emergency situation. The indicator affected is often reported and is widely used by different actors to convey the extent, impact, or severity of a disaster in non-spatial terms. In case that no values for the attribute `Total_Deaths` are available this attribute could be used as a proxy."

    "#### Missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, data is collected from multiple sources and therefore there is always the possibility of missing values. The data set contains a total of 16.132 recorded events starting from 1900 up to 2021. For the attribute `Total Deaths` it can be seen that 4.647 records have a missing value which corresponds to a portion of approximately 29% of missing values. Due to the nature of the available data, interpolation of missing values is not appropriate, as disasters can vary significantly in severity, location, and number of people killed. One way to approximate the missing data in terms of deaths is to use the number of affected. However, it must be taken into account that this number is sometimes considerably different from the number of deaths and always overestimates them. Looking at the distribtuion of missing values per decade one can see that the majority of records is from the 1980s or later. When it comes to geografical location of the records with missing data one can observe that the majority of disasters are linked to Americas and Asia. \n"

We are stating this because there was at the beginning our assumption, which stated that as the more we looked into the deaths from natural disasters of later years, the less there would be because the world standard is also increasing (new more quality buildings, better healthcare...). We notice that is not the case. From geographical perspective, there is no trend that goes for one specific region. Countries regardless of their position are getting maxed number of deaths, which also implies that GW is not predominately increasing hits for countries close to the equator but also from all parts of the world.\n",

    "From the second plot, we are trying to see which countries suffer the most proportionally. The most important trend which we can notice is how the countries far away from equator change their color over time. For example, take Europe. In the first decades we see that it is mostly \"untouched\" but the furthermore we look we can see it changes colors. Also goes for Russia, South Africa... All the countries from the world are experience proportionally more deaths by each decade and to state even worse, the map is getting similar colors for all countries.

    "From the first visualization, we can see that the deadliest disaster is Climatological, and the least deadly is Geophysical. This is a bit ironic because if we look at the second plot, we can see that the number of deaths from Climatological disasters was rapidly decreasing for decades while Geophysical stayed on average the same for all years. Without a second plot, this would definitely mislead us in our conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most common types of Climatological disaster are droughts and wildfires. This information certainly explains why the number of deaths have been decreasing over the years. It certainly is connected to better water supply for all household over the world's and better wildfire localization. Biological is also in decline (pandemics and diseases), and it can be also explained by overall better healthcare worldwide. Hydrological is very oscillating, which can infer that there were very deadly floods back in the time. The good news is that it is also in decline. Meteorological (cyclones and storms) is in a little incline. Alongside Geophysical disaster (earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity), Meteorological disaster represent the main type of disaster problem these days. The fact that Geophysical's number of deaths is very constant, says that humankind is still struggling to find solution on how to deal with this type of disaster. If we can find common ground between these two disasters, it would for sure be very poor type of constructions where the people live."

    "\n",
    "As already discussed when answering the previous two questions, several trends with respect to disaster occurrences are identifiable in the dataset. In this section we delved deeper into trends within the different disaster subgroups and (sub-)types as well as their potential relationship to global warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was shown that yearly flood and storm occurrences correlate most strongly with the global temperature, whereas occurrences of animal accidents, insect infestation and fog have only a slight positive or in the latter case even a negative correlation. For each of these disaster subtypes, a linear regression model was devised, with the results suggesting a relationship between global temperatures and disaster occurrences. However, a causal link between disaster occurrences and global temperature could not be conclusively demonstrated, since the results could be due to the hardly eliminable survivorship bias in the disaster dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the relation between total disaster occurrences and temperature was investigated per country. A separate comprehensive dataset was acquired and transformed but no the result no relationship could be demonstrated, as visibly clear in the last scatter/regression figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a causal connection between global warming has been shown to causally influence natural disaster occurrences in academic climate research, our research project could only hint at this relationship. We conclude that our research question and the underlying climatological processes are, in hindsight, too complex achieve any conclusively answers within our limited project scope."
